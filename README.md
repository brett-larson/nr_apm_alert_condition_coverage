# New Relic APM Alert Coverage Report
## Description
This Python program provides information about New Relic APM entities within a given account. Specifically, this program creates a CSV file with APM Entity Name and GUID, the current reporting status (i.e., if the entity is actively sending data to New Relic), and whether or not the entity is covered by Alert Conditions.
